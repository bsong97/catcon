# Method of Lines method 
# to discretize all but one dimension
# effectively turning PDEs into ODEs
# and therefore ODESolver can be used to solve

# Requirement:
# PDE should be an Initial Value Problem (Cauchy problem) because ODE integrators are IVP
# Thus, elliptic equations such as Laplace equation cannot be used
